## The First 72 Hours: The Decompression Period

**THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL TIME. Your foster dog needs REST, not socialization.**

### The 3-3-3 Rule

| Time Period | What's Happening |
|-------------|------------------|
| First 3 Days | Overwhelmed, shut down, may not eat or show true personality |
| First 3 Weeks | Starting to settle, learning routine, personality emerging |
| First 3 Months | Fully comfortable, true personality shown, bonded with foster |

### Day 1-3 Guidelines

**DO:**
- Keep things CALM and QUIET
- Let the dog decompress in their crate or safe space
- Offer food and water (don't worry if they don't eat much)
- Take outside on leash for potty breaks only
- Speak softly and move slowly
- Let them approach you - don't force interaction

**DON'T:**
- Introduce to other pets yet
- Have visitors over to meet the new dog
- Take to pet stores, dog parks, or busy places
- Force affection or handling
- Leave alone with children unsupervised
- Let off leash in unfenced areas (EVER in first 2 weeks minimum)

### Signs of Stress (Normal in First Days)

- Not eating or drinking much
- Excessive sleeping
- Hiding or avoiding interaction
- Panting when not hot
- Yawning frequently
- Pacing or inability to settle
- Diarrhea or soft stool
- House accidents (even if previously trained)

**These behaviors typically improve within 3-7 days. Contact fostersupport@pawsitivehaven.org if they worsen or don't improve after one week.**

## Potty Training Your Foster

### The Protocol

1. **Take outside immediately** when you take them out of the crate
2. **Go to the same spot** every time
3. **Use a cue word** ("go potty" or similar)
4. **WAIT** - give them 5-10 minutes minimum
5. **Praise calmly** when they go (no excited celebrations yet)
6. **Take out frequently**: After meals, after naps, after play, every 2-3 hours

### Potty Schedule (First Week)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| Wake up | Immediately outside |
| After breakfast | Outside within 15 min |
| Mid-morning | Outside |
| After lunch | Outside within 15 min |
| Mid-afternoon | Outside |
| After dinner | Outside within 15 min |
| Before bed | Outside |
| Overnight | Once if needed (puppies) |

### Accidents Happen

- **Clean with enzymatic cleaner** (regular cleaners don't remove scent)
- **Don't punish** - they don't understand
- **Supervise more closely** or crate when you can't watch
- **Note patterns** - timing, location, circumstances

---

## Crate Training

### Why Crate?

- Provides safe, secure space
- Aids in house training
- Keeps dog safe when unsupervised
- Prepares for transport and vet visits
- Gives the dog a break when overwhelmed

### Making the Crate Positive

1. Place crate in quiet area with blankets inside
2. Feed meals in the crate (door open at first)
3. Toss treats inside randomly throughout day
4. Never use crate as punishment
5. Cover with a blanket if dog seems anxious (creates den-like feel)

### Crate Schedule Guidance

- Puppies: Age in months + 1 = max hours
- Adults: 4-6 hours max during day
- Overnight: Can be longer (dogs sleep)

**Excessive barking or whining?** Wait for a quiet moment before letting out. Contact behavior@pawsitivehaven.org for persistent issues.

---

## Introducing to Resident Pets

**WAIT MINIMUM 3-5 DAYS before any introductions.**

### Dog-to-Dog Introductions

**Phase 1: Scent Introduction (Days 3-5)**
- Swap blankets between dogs
- Let them sniff under the door
- Feed on opposite sides of a closed door

**Phase 2: Visual Introduction (Days 5-7)**
- Parallel walks outside (separate handlers, 20+ feet apart)
- Gradually decrease distance over multiple walks
- Watch for relaxed body language

**Phase 3: Controlled Meeting (Week 2+)**
- Meet in neutral territory (not your home/yard)
- Both dogs on leash, loose leash
- Keep moving, keep it short (5 min)
- End on positive note

**Phase 4: Home Introduction**
- Start with supervised time in same room
- Separate for meals and high-value items
- Increase time together gradually
- Always supervise until fully trusted

### Cat Introductions

1. Keep completely separated for minimum 1 week
2. Scent swapping (blankets, feeding near door)
3. Visual through baby gate (dog on leash)
4. Very slow, always supervise
5. **Some dogs cannot live with cats** - watch for prey drive

## After Quarantine: Building the Bond

### Training Basics

**Start simple - set your foster up for success:**

- **Name recognition**: Say name, treat when they look
- **Sit**: Lure with treat, reward when bottom hits ground
- **Leash manners**: Stop when they pull, move when leash is loose
- **Crate cue**: Toss treat in, add "kennel" or "crate"

**Training tips:**
- Keep sessions short (5 min)
- Use high-value treats
- End on success
- Be patient - they're learning a lot

### Exercise Guidelines

| Dog Type | Daily Exercise |
|----------|----------------|
| Puppy | Short walks, play sessions, mental games |
| Adult (low energy) | 30-45 min walks |
| Adult (high energy) | 60+ min walks, running, fetch |
| Senior | Short walks, gentle activity |

**Remember:** Mental exercise tires dogs too! Food puzzles, training, sniff walks.

### Socialization (After 2-Week Quarantine)

Start slow and watch body language:
- New people (one at a time first)
- New environments (quiet places first)
- New sounds and surfaces
- Car rides
- Handling (touch ears, paws, mouth gently)
